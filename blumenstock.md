[Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development](https://www.nature.com/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06215-5/d41586-018-06215-5.pdf) Nature: Sept. 2018

## Question
*Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.*

*Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article.*

*“Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people’s experiences” Anna Raymond*

*“Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results” Nira Nair*

*“In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult.” Kayla Seggelke*

*How do you respond to these ideas regarding “good intent”, “transparency” and the difficult “balancing act” when considering the intersection of human development with data science?*

## Response

Blumenstock believes that collaboration is the key way forward for data science. He believes that data science can be more beneficial when it is not just used on its own, but by combining new sources of data, such as that from mobile phones, with more conventional ones, and promoting collaboration between data scientists and experts in other fields, such as development experts. Such collaboration can prevent pitfalls that may otherwise arise if the data does not show the whole picture.

I agree that good intent is not enough when it comes to data science or machine learning. Although there is a lot of potential in the field of data science, good intent does not justify the possibly disastrous consequences misusing this tool could have. Collaboration is important because someone in another field can analyze the potential consequences of using big data for a problem or catch something that a programmer may overlook, such as the pitfalls of unanticipated effects and biased data that Blumenstock mentions. I think it is important, as Blumenstock said, that in designing solutions there are people who “understand the problems and context,” and not just the algorithms.
