[Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development](https://www.nature.com/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06215-5/d41586-018-06215-5.pdf) Nature: Sept. 2018

## Question
*Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.*

*Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article.*

*“Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people’s experiences” Anna Raymond*

*“Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results” Nira Nair*

*“In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult.” Kayla Seggelke*

*How do you respond to these ideas regarding “good intent”, “transparency” and the difficult “balancing act” when considering the intersection of human development with data science?*

## Response
The promise of big data in development according to Blumenstock is that it could help governments and organizations with delivering humanitarian aid and help those in poverty, as well as with relief efforts after natural disasters, or intervention in an epidemic or other crises. 

One of the pitfalls Blumenstock mentions is the lack of validation. I think it is important to recognize the differences between big data and conventional development data, and the potential pitfalls of big data, such as the fact that the risks of using it are not as well known as conventional data and that big data is often produced by private companies and can be affected by commercial interests. Big data used for development is not usually collected with that purpose in mind, whereas the collection of conventional development data may have been more carefully considered in context. Blumenstock believes that data science can be more beneficial when it is not just used on its own, but by combining new sources of data, such as that from mobile phones, with more conventional ones. 

I think it is important not to lose sight of ethics in the protection of human subjects in research when it comes to big data. We cannot overlook potential risks, like with the payday loans Blumenstock mentions. Also, the lack of regulation and informed consent of the people about whom data is being collected is concerning. This is alarmingly inconsistent with the ideal of informed consent in social science research.

I agree that good intent is not enough when it comes to data science or machine learning. Although there is a lot of potential in the field of data science, good intent does not justify the possibly disastrous consequences misusing this tool could have. Blumenstock believes that collaboration is the key way forward for data science. Collaboration is important because someone in another field can analyze the potential consequences of using big data for a problem or catch something that a programmer may overlook, such as the pitfalls of unanticipated effects and biased data that Blumenstock mentions. I think it is important, as Blumenstock said, that in designing solutions there are people who “understand the problems and context,” and not just the algorithms.
