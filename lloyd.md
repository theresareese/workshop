## Question
Perspective Question: In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors introduce a method that uses a number of different openly available geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations. Describe the geospatial datasets the authors are using in their methodology. How is their method an improvement when compared to a conventional census? Are you able to describe how the authors use a number of different geospatial layers with their data science method in order to produce a high resolution, global gridded description of human population?
